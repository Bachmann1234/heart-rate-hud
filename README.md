# heart-rate-hud
Display heart rate in a computer display

The initial implementation of this was designed to work with the CMS50D+ pulse oximeter. The device
requires a [driver file](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx) to work

Interacting with this device requires a python module not currently on PyPi. [Clone the code](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/CMS50Dplus)

[This is the original repo](https://github.com/atbrask/CMS50Dplus) However, at the time of this writing there is no setup.py. (Hense the fork)
